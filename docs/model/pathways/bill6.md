# Standard (post Ord. 26-7)

The Standard pathway is baseline development under the apartment and business district standards as amended by Ordinance 26-7 (Bill 6, 2026). It runs in `src/calculations/calc-bill6.ts`, program id `bill6` (the id predates the rename). Everything not listed here follows [Housing Policy Simulator logic](../simulator-logic.md).

## Envelope

| Rule | Standard |
| --- | --- |
| FAR | Table 21-3.3 as amended by Ord. 26-7: A-1/AMX-1 2.0; A-2/AMX-2 3.0; A-3/AMX-3 and the Waikiki precincts 4.0. Business districts keep Table 21-3.4: B-1 1.0, B-2 2.5, BMX-3 2.5, BMX-4 4.0 |
| Open-space bonus | B-2 and BMX-3 up to 3.5, BMX-4 up to 7.5, with 1 sq ft of plaza per 5 sq ft of bonus floor area (see [Open-space bonus](../simulator-logic.md#open-space-bonus)) |
| Lot coverage | 60% in the apartment and AMX districts (Ord. 26-7 replaced the lot-size tiers with a flat 60%); 100% in business districts; the Waikiki precincts keep 35–50% of the lot open (see [Special districts](special-districts.md)) |
| Height | The parcel's zoned height in the Citywide View (30 ft when the record has none), which the Max Height lever adds to or subtracts from; the Max Height slider in the Project View (default 30 ft) |
| Ground-floor retail | Allowed in AMX-1, AMX-2, AMX-3, BMX-3, BMX-4 and the Waikiki Apartment Mixed Use Subprecinct |
| Unit cap | None |

## Height setbacks

Standard applies each zone's step-back rule. Before Ord. 26-7, 201H and TOD apply the same rules through their underlying zone. Ord. 26-7 left these rules unchanged.

| Zone | Rule | Yards affected | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A-2, A-3 | Above 40 ft: +1 ft per 10 ft of height or portion | Side and rear | ROH § 21-3.80-1(c)(2) |
| AMX-2, AMX-3 | Above 40 ft: +1 ft per 10 ft | Side and rear | ROH § 21-3.90-1(c) |
| B-2, BMX-3, IMX-1 | Above 40 ft: +1 ft per 10 ft | Side and rear | Ord. 17-55 |
| BMX-4 | Modeled with the BMX-3 rule | Side and rear | The LUO uses a 65° street-angle plane instead (§ 21-3.120-2(c)) |
| Resort | Above 30 ft: +1 ft per 10 ft | Side and rear | ROH § 21-3.100-1(c)(3) |
| Waikiki Apartment Precinct and Apartment Mixed Use Subprecinct | Above 40 ft: +1 ft per 10 ft | Front, side and rear | ROH § 21-9.80-5(c)(2) |
| A-1, AMX-1 | None | — | LUO Table 21-3.3 |

How a step-back is applied storey by storey, with a worked example, is in [Height setbacks](../simulator-logic.md#height-setbacks).

**Not modeled:** BMX-4's actual 65° street-angle plane (the BMX-3 rule stands in for it).

## Parking and loading

| Requirement | Standard |
| --- | --- |
| Housing stalls | 1 per 1,000 sq ft of dwelling area (0.5 per one-bedroom), Table 21-6.1 |
| Retail stalls | 1 per 500 sq ft |
| Joint use | 90% when housing and retail both need stalls (Table 21-6.2) |
| Loading | Lots over 7,500 sq ft (Table 21-6.5) |
| Bicycle parking | Required (§ 21-6.40) |
| § 21-6.20(a) exemption | Applied parcel by parcel: exempt parcels (Primary Urban Center, Ewa, near rail) need no car stalls but still need loading and bicycle parking. 6,998 of 9,444 Standard parcels are exempt |

**Impact of the exemption.** Citywide View totals with all one-bedroom units and the Parking lever unset, retail off, with the Article 6 minimum on every parcel and then with the exemption applied: stalls fall from 623,728 to 120,384, units rise from 1,243,569 to 1,444,875, and parcels rated strong rise from 176 to 5,159. The default 0.95 ratio puts housing stalls on exempt parcels too, so at the defaults, with retail off, the exemption changes nothing.

How stalls are counted, placed and priced is in [Parking and loading](../simulator-logic.md#parking-and-loading).

## Affordability

The model builds no affordable units in this pathway: it is rental only, and the Chapter 29 requirement is triggered by for-sale development.

**Table 29-1.4: affordable housing requirement, as a percentage of the total number of dwelling units in the principal project** (requirements in effect from April 3, 2018):

| Principal project location | For sale or rental | On-site production | Off-site production | Conveyance of land |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IPD-T projects, PD-T projects, or TOD special district projects seeking bonus height or density, or both | For sale | 30% / 20% / 10% | 30–35% / 20–25% / 10–15% | Conveyance of land |
| Same | For rental | 15% |  |  |
| All other areas | For sale | 15% / 10% / 5% | 15–20% / 10–15% / 5–10% | Conveyance of land |
| Same | For rental | 5% |  |  |

§ 29-1.4(a) says the requirement must be met by satisfying one or a combination of the options, and if a combination is used the declarant designates the proportionate share each option fulfills, with the shares summing to at least one. Moreover, for-rental affordable dwelling units must be rented to households earning 80 percent and below of the AMI.

***Note:*** since 8/25/26 sale units are no longer implemented. Under § 29-1.3 (Applicability) the Chapter 29 requirement is triggered by for-sale development, so the code models 0 affordable units in the Standard pathway (`afd_rent_units = 0` in `calc-bill6.ts`). The earlier assumption of 5% affordable rental units is commented out in the code.

## Fees, waivers and taxes

**Wastewater system facility charges:** Affordable dwelling units are exempt from wastewater facility charges entirely. In the model this is applied by charging the wastewater fee only on the non-affordable (market) unit count.

**Building permit and plan review fees:** waived in proportion to the affordable share (Ord. 19-8 § 4, adding ROH 18-6.5(i)). The building official waives these fees for "the portion of an affordable rental housing project equal to the percentage of affordable rental housing units."

**Park dedication:** affordable units exempt (Ord. 19-8 § 5, amending ROH 22-7.3(j)). The subdivision article's park-dedication requirement does not apply to affordable rental dwelling units. In the model, the park requirement is sized on chargeable (market) units only, so affordable units contribute no park-dedication cost or in-lieu fee.

**BWS water charges:** charged on market units under the default Impact Fees toggle (Market Units Only).

**Property tax:** full tax from year one.

***Note:*** the ordinance cited above is Bill 7's (Ord. 19-8); its waivers are keyed to affordable rental units, so they reach a Standard project only for the units it rents as affordable. Since the Standard pathway models no affordable units by default, every unit pays these fees.
