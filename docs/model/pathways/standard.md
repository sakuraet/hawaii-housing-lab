# Before Ord. 26-7

This pathway is baseline development under the apartment district standards as they stood before Ordinance 26-7 (Bill 6, 2026), kept for comparison. It runs in `src/calculations/calc-standard.ts`, program id `standard` (the id predates the rename; the current Standard pathway is [`bill6`](bill6.md)). It differs from Standard mainly in FAR and lot coverage, which scale with lot size. Everything not listed here follows [Housing Policy Simulator logic](../simulator-logic.md).

## Envelope

| Rule | Before Ord. 26-7 |
| --- | --- |
| FAR | Apartment and AMX FAR rises with lot area up to a cap (the pre-Ord. 26-7 Table 21-3.3 formulas, below). Business districts use Table 21-3.4: B-1 1.0, B-2 2.5, BMX-3 2.5, BMX-4 4.0 |
| Open-space bonus | B-2 and BMX-3 up to 3.5, BMX-4 up to 7.5, as in Standard (see [Open-space bonus](../simulator-logic.md#open-space-bonus)) |
| Lot coverage | Apartment and AMX districts: 60% of lots under 7,500 sq ft, 50% of lots up to 20,000 sq ft, and 40% above. Business districts 100%. The Waikiki precincts keep 35–50% of the lot open (see [Special districts](special-districts.md)) |
| Height | The zoned height in the Citywide View, which the Max Height lever adds to or subtracts from; the Max Height slider in the Project View (default 30 ft) |
| Ground-floor retail | Allowed in AMX-1, AMX-2, AMX-3, BMX-3, BMX-4 and the Waikiki Apartment Mixed Use Subprecinct |
| Unit cap | None |

**FAR formulas.** Lot area is in sq ft:

| Zones | Under 10,000 sq ft | 10,000 to 40,000 sq ft | Over 40,000 sq ft |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A-1, AMX-1 | 0.00003 × lot + 0.3 | 0.00001 × lot + 0.5 | 0.9 |
| A-2, AMX-2 | 0.00009 × lot + 0.4 | 0.00002 × lot + 1.1 | 1.9 |
| A-3, AMX-3 | 0.00014 × lot + 0.6 | 0.00004 × lot + 1.6 up to 20,000 sq ft; 0.00002 × lot + 2.0 above | 2.8 |
| Waikiki Apartment Precinct and Mixed Use | 0.00003 × lot + 1.3 | 0.00003 × lot + 1.3 up to 20,000 sq ft; 1.9 above | 1.9 |

Example: a 10,000 sq ft A-2 lot gets FAR 0.00002 × 10,000 + 1.1 = 1.3, against 3.0 under the current Standard pathway.

## Height setbacks

The same zone step-back rules as [Standard](bill6.md#height-setbacks); Ord. 26-7 did not change them.

## Parking and loading

The same Article 6 requirements as [Standard](bill6.md#parking-and-loading): 1 stall per 1,000 sq ft of dwelling area plus 1 per 500 sq ft of retail, 90% when combined, loading on lots over 7,500 sq ft, and bicycle parking. The § 21-6.20(a) exemption applies parcel by parcel: 6,998 of 9,444 parcels are exempt.

**Impact of the exemption.** Citywide View totals with all one-bedroom units and the Parking lever unset, retail off, with the Article 6 minimum on every parcel and then with the exemption applied: stalls fall from 445,399 to 78,049, units rise from 886,336 to 1,022,077, and parcels rated strong rise from 93 to 1,987. The default 0.95 ratio puts housing stalls on exempt parcels too, so at the defaults, with retail off, the exemption changes nothing.

## Affordability

The model builds no affordable units in this pathway. The Table 29-1.4 requirements are the same as under [Standard](bill6.md#affordability).

***Note:*** since 8/25/26 sale units are no longer implemented. Under § 29-1.3 (Applicability) the Chapter 29 requirement is triggered by for-sale development, so the code models 0 affordable units in this pathway (`afd_rent_units = 0` in `calc-standard.ts`). The earlier assumption of 5% affordable rental units is commented out in the code.

## Fees, waivers and taxes

**Wastewater system facility charges:** waived for affordable rental housing units rented to households earning 100 percent and below of the AMI.

**Park dedication:** park land is charged only on units not exempt under § 22-7.3(j); in other words only market units are charged toward the park dedication requirement.

**BWS water charges:** charged on market units under the default Impact Fees toggle (Market Units Only).

**Property tax:** full tax from year one.

***Note:*** these waivers reach only units rented as affordable. Since the pathway models no affordable units by default, every unit pays these fees.
