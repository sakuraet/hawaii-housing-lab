# Model documentation

How the model works and where its numbers come from, for Honolulu's pathways. These pages come from the documentation of UHERO's `@uhero/feasim` package (its `minor-fixes` branch, November 9, 2026), which this repository's engine was built from. The [README](../../README.md) covers running the engine and the tool.

**What's different in this repository:**

- **Rules and assumptions are in county config files.** Honolulu's are in `src/localities/hi/honolulu/`, and each neighbor-island county has its own folder. The constants these pages name keep their names in `src/calculations/calc-shared.ts`, which reads Honolulu's values from that config. For example, `INCOME_LIMITS` is `honolulu.rules.income_limits`, and the conveyance tax schedule is in the state config, `src/localities/hi/state.ts`.
- **The neighbor-island counties run one more pathway, `current`.** It is current zoning, read from each zone's `current` rules. For Honolulu, `current` is the same as `bill6`. Each county's rules and sources are in [docs/notes](../notes/), for example [MAUI.md](../notes/MAUI.md).
- **The tool in `web/` is a Citywide View only,** across all four counties. The Project View these pages mention is UHERO's single-lot calculator; here it corresponds to `calcSingle`.

## Start here

- [Housing Policy Simulator logic](simulator-logic.md): the pipeline every pathway runs, from the building envelope through costs, financing, revenue and residual land value to the verdict.
- [Variables](variables.md): every lever, constant and calculation function in the code, with its value, source and how often to review it, followed by the assumption history: retired assumptions and what the model does now, and loopholes.

## Pathways

Each pathway page describes only what differs from the shared [Housing Policy Simulator logic](simulator-logic.md). The code name is the pathway's `program` id. The ids are historical: `bill6` is current zoning and `standard` is the rules before Ordinance 26-7.

| Page | `program` | Summary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Standard (post Ord. 26-7)](pathways/bill6.md) | `bill6` | Baseline development under the apartment standards as amended by Ord. 26-7 |
| [Before Ord. 26-7](pathways/standard.md) | `standard` | Baseline development under the apartment standards before Ord. 26-7 |
| [Bill 7](pathways/bill7.md) | `bill7` | ROH Chapter 32: affordable rental housing, FAR 4.0 and 60 ft cap, no required parking, most fees waived, and a 15-year real property tax exemption |
| [TOD (IPD-T / PD-T)](pathways/tod.md) | `tod` | Transit-oriented development near rail stations: permit tiers that raise FAR and height, no required car parking, and higher affordability requirements |
| [201H](pathways/h201.md) | `h201` | HRS Chapter 201H: state affordable projects with a required 50% + 1 affordable minimum |
| [Special districts](pathways/special-districts.md) | (not a separate pathway) | Districts with their own zoning rules, such as the Waikiki Apartment Precinct |

## Project and Citywide view

UHERO's Housing Policy Simulator has two views, and these pages refer to both:

- **Project View:** analyzes a single hypothetical lot. The user sets every physical and financial input. In this package that is `calcSingle`.
- **Citywide View:** runs the same calculations across real parcels. Lot size, zone and height come from the parcel records, and the user adjusts the financial and policy assumptions. The Max Height and Max FAR levers start at Baseline and add to or subtract from each parcel's own limit. In this package that is `calcParcel`, which takes the resulting height and FAR.

## History

The model was originally inspired by the [Terner Center Development Calculator](https://ternercenter.berkeley.edu/proforma/). Unlike that tool, the current model evaluates feasibility through developer return metrics (levered IRR, return on cost, equity multiple and residual land value per square foot). It also models two developer strategies: a quick build ("dev flip", sell at stabilization) and a hold (refinance into permanent debt, collect cash flow, sell at exit).

The Housing Policy Simulator began as an R project ([documentation](https://github.com/UHERO/Terner-Center-Dashboard/blob/main/README.md#resources)), was rebuilt in TypeScript inside UHERO's dashboard codebase, and is published as `@uhero/feasim`. This repository's engine started from it and keeps its Honolulu results: the snapshot tests in `test/__snapshots__` match the package's.
